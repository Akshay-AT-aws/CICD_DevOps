Step 1: Set Up Jenkins Master
Install Jenkins:

Set up a Jenkins master on your local machine or a dedicated VM.
Install Jenkins Plugins:

Install necessary plugins for Docker integration, GitHub integration, and any other plugins required for your CI/CD pipeline.
Configure Jenkins:

Set up Jenkins configuration, including system settings, credentials, and configure any necessary plugins.


Step 2: Set Up Source Code Repository (GitHub)
Create GitHub Repository:

Create a GitHub repository to host your Django application code.
Push Code to GitHub:

Push your Django application code to the GitHub repository.


Step 3: Set Up Dockerfile
Create Dockerfile:

Write a Dockerfile for your Django application to define the Docker image.
Build Docker Image Locally:

Test building the Docker image locally on your development machine.


Step 4: Set Up Jenkins Pipeline for Local Deployment
Create Jenkins Pipeline Script:

Write a Jenkinsfile to define the CI/CD pipeline stages for building and deploying the Docker image locally.
Test Local Deployment:

Run the Jenkins pipeline to test the local deployment on your machine.


Step 5: Set Up Infrastructure with Terraform
Write Terraform Configuration:

Write Terraform configuration files for creating AWS resources (VPC, security groups, EC2 instances, etc.).
Create Remote Backend:

Use Terraform to create a remote backend (S3 bucket and DynamoDB table) for storing Terraform state.


Step 6: Set Up Jenkins Worker EC2 Instance
Write Terraform Configuration:

Extend your Terraform configuration to include the creation of an EC2 instance for the Jenkins worker.
Install Docker and Jenkins Agent on Worker:

Use user data or provisioning scripts to install Docker and set up the Jenkins agent on the worker EC2 instance.


Step 7: Set Up Jenkins Pipeline for AWS Deployment
Update Jenkins Pipeline Script:

Modify the Jenkinsfile to include stages for AWS deployment, utilizing the Jenkins worker.
Test AWS Deployment:

Run the Jenkins pipeline to deploy the application to AWS, targeting the dev and staging environments.


Step 8: Set Up ASG for Production
Write Terraform Configuration:

Extend your Terraform configuration to include the creation of an Auto Scaling Group (ASG) for production.
Update Jenkins Pipeline Script:

Modify the Jenkinsfile to include stages for deploying to the production environment using the ASG.


Step 9: Test End-to-End Deployment
Run End-to-End Test:

Execute the complete CI/CD pipeline to ensure a smooth end-to-end deployment process.
Address Issues:

Identify and address any issues encountered during the deployment process.


Step 10: Fine-Tune and Optimize
Optimize Infrastructure:

Fine-tune your Terraform configurations and infrastructure settings for better performance and cost optimization.
Refine Jenkins Pipeline:

Refine the Jenkins pipeline script based on feedback and improvements.


Step 11: Document and Maintain
Documentation:

Document the CI/CD pipeline, infrastructure setup, and any specific configurations.
Maintenance Plan:

Establish a maintenance plan for ongoing updates, security patches, and improvements.
